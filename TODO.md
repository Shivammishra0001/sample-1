# Fix CSS Path Issue

## Problem

All HTML files are linking to "css/style.css", but the CSS file is located in the root directory as "style.css". This causes the CSS not to load, resulting in unstyled pages.

## Solution

Update the CSS link in all HTML files from "css/style.css" to "style.css".

## Tasks

- [x] Update CSS link in index.html
- [x] Update CSS link in about.html
- [x] Update CSS link in services.html
- [x] Update CSS link in packages.html
- [x] Update CSS link in team.html
- [x] Update CSS link in contact.html

## Verification

After updates, open the HTML files in a browser to confirm CSS is loading properly.
